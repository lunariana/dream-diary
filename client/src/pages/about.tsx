        <h1>about the dream diary</h1>
        <p>welcome to the realm of dreams, a mysterious landscape where reality takes a backseat, and imagination runs wild. in this dream diary, we embark on a journey through the ethereal corridors of the subconscious mind, where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary, and the boundaries of possibility are pushed to their limits. each entry is a glimpse into the tapestry of the night, where dreams weave intricate tales, exploring the depths of our emotions, fears, and desires.</p>
        <p>it's a curious fact that, on average, people tend to forget up to 95% of their dreams within the first five minutes of waking up. the delicate threads of dreamscapes, woven with intricate details, slip away from our grasp as the waking world gradually takes precedence. this phenomenon is attributed to the rapid eye movement (rem) stage of sleep, where most of our vivid dreaming occurs. during this phase, the brain is highly active, crafting elaborate scenarios and narratives. however, the transition to wakefulness often results in a swift dissolution of these fleeting dream memories.</p>
        <p>join me in capturing these evanescent moments, attempting to preserve the essence of dreams that vanish like morning mist. together, let us explore the mystery of why the subconscious world slips away so effortlessly from the corridors of our waking consciousness. each entry in this dream diary is a glimpse into the tapestry of the night, where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary, and the boundaries of possibility are pushed to their limits.</p>
